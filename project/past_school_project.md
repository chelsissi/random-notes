1. Digit Recognition

>  * Applied Random Forest to solve the digit recognizer problem on Kaggle. I implemented random forest algorithm in a 
>  parallel way to train a classifier which can automatically recognize hand-written digits. My best result achieved a 
>  96.7% accuracy rate.
>  
>  * Classified 70,000 handwritten zip code numbers with misclassification rate around 2.5% by machine learning methods 
>  such as PCA and k-Nearest Neighbors methods using R.
  
2. Flight Data Research

>  * Analyzed flight data of American commercial airlines from 1987 to 2008. The data is about 16 gigabytes and I used SQLite 
>  to store the data in a database. Then I connected R with this database so I could write SQL to extract data interested me 
>  and store and manipulate it in R. Many interesting patterns were found, for example, JetBlue has been the biggest carrier 
>  in JFK since 2003.
>
>  * Data cleaning on 12 gigabytes of data of flight details for all commercial flights within the USA from Oct. 1987 to Dec. 
>  2008 using SQL. Analyzed important features of flights delay by regression models and experimental designs using R; 
>  Performed visualizations of the relationships; Suggested useful tips for travelers.
>
>  * Recognized patterns in delayed flights through visualizing delay rate on influential factors, such as departure, 
>  destination, carrier, travel day and time. Managed a 12 GB data set of commercial flight records through SQL and R 
>  interaction.

3. Biomarkers for Early Stage Detection of Diabetes

>  * Constructed biomarkers between the normal sample and the diabetic sample by stepwise discriminant analysis and logistic 
>  model using R. Made a decision rule on training data and classified test data by k-Nearest Neighbors method.
